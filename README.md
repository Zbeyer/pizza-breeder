# pizza-breeder
A game about breeding pizza

**Idea:** Two pizzas go into the oven, a litter of pizzas are produced



| **Toppings**           | [{name, weight, traits (oiliness)}]                          |      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- |
| Diameter               | Grows with age to fill container:                            |      |
| Maturity Rate          | How quickly does a pizza transforms from young (each stage can add additional traits. High maturity rate & high preservation allows a pizza to reach epic, ancient, etc). |      |
| Preservation           | How long is a pizza's average life expectancy (before it dies) |      |
| Growth Rate            | How quickly does the pizza advance in diameter               |      |
| Thin / Doughy          | Float Interpolation                                          |      |
| Crispiness / Sogginess | Float: Interpolation                                         |      |
| Boxed Date             | When a pizza is boxed its age is suspend according to the quality of its box (simple, advanced, Golden, etc) Boxed pizzas cannot grow larger. |      |
|                        |                                                              |      |
|                        |                                                              |      |

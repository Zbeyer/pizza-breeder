# pizza-breeder
A game about breeding pizza

**Idea:** Two pizzas go into the oven, a litter of pizzas are produced



| **Toppings**             | [{name, weight, traits (oiliness)}]                          |      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- |
| Diameter                 | <Number>* Grows with age to fill container:                  |      |
| MaturityRate             | <Number> How quickly does a pizza transforms from young (each stage can add additional traits. High maturity rate & high preservation allows a pizza to reach epic, ancient, etc). |      |
| PreservationScore        | <Number> How long is a pizza's average life expectancy (before it dies) |      |
| Growth Rate              | <Number> How quickly does the pizza advance in diameter      |      |
| Thin vs. Doughy          | <Float> Interpolation between 0 & 1                          |      |
| Crispiness vs. Sogginess | <Float> Float: Interpolation 0 & 1                           |      |
| Boxed Date               | <Date> When a pizza is boxed its age is suspend according to the quality of its box (simple, advanced, Golden, etc) Boxed pizzas cannot grow larger.<br />Boxed Pizzas do not age while game is closed* |      |
